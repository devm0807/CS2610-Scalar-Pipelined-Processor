Pipeline Processor Simulator

We take 3 files as the input -  DCache.txt, ICache.txt, RF.txt

Then 

1)Enter the instructions for the processor in the ICache.txt file. Each instruction is spread across 2 lines - a byte for each line.

2)Enter the appropriate intial values in the DCache.txt and RF.txt files.

3)Run the main.cpp file, which will generate two files-

a)Output.txt : Contains stats for processor b)ODCache.txt : Contains final DCache config
